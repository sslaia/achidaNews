# achidaNews
Daily news briefing. It focuses on news provided by selected reputable news outlets such as The Guardian, BBC, CNN, etc. Written based on architecture component guidelines.

## Notes
There is another news app in this repository list, i.e. GuNews. GuNews was written with "no-fake-news principle" in mind, therefore the app only shows news from theguardian.com, one of the few trustworthy news outlets out there.

achidaNews tries to add more reputable news sources such as BBC, CNN, etc. and a category for country news which is not "no-fake-news-proof" but maybe attractive to non english users.
